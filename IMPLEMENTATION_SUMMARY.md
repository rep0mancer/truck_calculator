# Bidirectional Placement with Axle Load Check - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented bidirectional pallet placement with axle load checks and a "light stacks in front" exception for the truck loading calculator React/Next.js application.

## What Was Changed

### File Modified
- `/workspace/src/app/page.tsx`

### Key Changes

#### 1. Enhanced PALLET_TYPES (Line 72-75)
Added `weightKg: 0` property to both euro and industrial pallet types to support weight-based calculations.

```typescript
const PALLET_TYPES = {
  euro: { ..., weightKg: 0 },
  industrial: { ..., weightKg: 0 }
};
```

#### 2. Bidirectional Placement Logic (Lines 378-626)
Completely rewrote the placement phase (STAGE 2) with:

##### Constants for Configuration (Lines 381-399)
```typescript
const FRONT_NO_STACK_BUFFER_CM = 120;      // Front buffer zone
const STACKS_FROM_REAR = true;             // Default bias for stacks

const LIMITS = {
  STEER_MAX_KG: 8000,
  DRIVE_MAX_KG: 11500,
  TRAILER_BOGIE_MAX_KG: 24000,
  SAFETY: 0.97,                            // 3% safety buffer
  FRONT_STACK_MAX_PALLET_KG: 500          // Max weight per pallet for front stacking
};

const TARE = {
  steer: 6500,        // kg - Steering axle tare weight
  drive: 4500,        // kg - Drive axle tare weight
  trailerBogie: 3000  // kg - Trailer bogie tare weight
};

const KP_SHARE = { min: 0.12, max: 0.35 };  // Kingpin share heuristic
const KP_TO_DRIVE = 0.70;                    // 70% of kingpin load goes to drive axle
```

##### Axle Load Helper Functions (Lines 402-428)

**`kingpinShareAt(xFromFrontCm, unitLengthCm)`**
- Calculates the proportion of pallet weight that goes through the kingpin
- Linear interpolation: front positions → higher kingpin share, rear → lower
- Range: 0.35 (front) to 0.12 (rear)

**`sumLoads(items)`**
- Simulates total axle loads given a set of placed pallets
- Returns: `{ steer, drive, trailerBogie }` in kg
- Includes tare weights + payload distribution

**`withinLimits(loads)`**
- Checks if axle loads are within safe limits
- Applies 3% safety factor (LIMITS.SAFETY = 0.97)

##### Bidirectional Cursor System (Lines 441-448)
```typescript
// Front cursor (grows left to right)
let frontX = 0, frontY = 0, frontRowHeight = 0;

// Rear cursor (grows right to left)
let rearX = unit.length, rearY = 0, rearRowHeight = 0;
```

##### Placement Decision Logic (Lines 494-542)

**Standard Rule:**
1. Stacks → rear (if `STACKS_FROM_REAR = true`)
2. Singles → front

**Hard Block:**
- Heavy stacks (> 500kg/pallet) are blocked from the front 120cm buffer zone

**Light Stack Exception:**
- Stacks with pallets ≤ 500kg can go to front IF:
  - Axle load simulation shows all loads within limits
  - Compares front vs rear placement
  - Chooses front only if safe, otherwise falls back to rear

##### Collision Prevention (Lines 571-577)
```typescript
// Front and rear cursors must not overlap
if (side === 'front' && frontX + palletLen > rearX) break;
if (side === 'rear' && rearX - palletLen < frontX) break;
```

##### Actual Positioning (Line 583)
```typescript
const actualX = side === 'front' ? currentX : (currentX - palletLen);
```
- Front: position at current X
- Rear: position at (current X - pallet length) since rear cursor tracks the right edge

## How It Works

### Placement Flow
1. **Manifest Selection** (unchanged) - Determines which pallets to load
2. **Priority Sorting** (unchanged) - Orders pallets: DIN stacks → EUP stacks → DIN singles → EUP singles
3. **Bidirectional Placement** (NEW):
   - For each pallet, determine if it should go front or rear
   - If light stack, run axle simulation
   - Place at appropriate cursor position
   - Update cursor (front grows right, rear grows left)
   - Check for collisions before each placement

### Axle Load Simulation Logic
For light stacks (≤500kg/pallet):
1. Calculate proposed position (front X or rear X)
2. Collect all already-placed pallets with their X positions
3. Create two candidate scenarios:
   - Candidate A: Add stack to front position
   - Candidate B: Add stack to rear position
4. For each candidate, calculate:
   - Kingpin share based on X position
   - Distribution to steer/drive/trailer axles
5. Check if front candidate is within limits
6. If yes → allow front placement
7. If no → fall back to rear placement

### Weight Distribution Model
```
Total Load = Pallet Weight
Kingpin Share = f(xPosition) = 0.35 (front) to 0.12 (rear)
Trailer Share = 1 - Kingpin Share

From Kingpin:
  Steer Axle += Kingpin Share × 0.30
  Drive Axle += Kingpin Share × 0.70
  
From Trailer:
  Trailer Bogie += Trailer Share × 1.00
```

## Configuration

### To Adjust Behavior

**Make more/less stacks eligible for front placement:**
```typescript
LIMITS.FRONT_STACK_MAX_PALLET_KG: 500  // Increase for more eligible stacks
```

**Adjust axle limits:**
```typescript
LIMITS.STEER_MAX_KG: 8000      // Steering axle limit
LIMITS.DRIVE_MAX_KG: 11500     // Drive axle limit
LIMITS.TRAILER_BOGIE_MAX_KG: 24000  // Trailer limit
```

**Change safety margin:**
```typescript
LIMITS.SAFETY: 0.97  // 0.97 = 3% buffer, 0.95 = 5% buffer
```

**Update tare weights (if you know actual truck weights):**
```typescript
TARE.steer: 6500      // Your truck's steering axle tare
TARE.drive: 4500      // Your truck's drive axle tare
TARE.trailerBogie: 3000  // Your trailer's bogie tare
```

**Adjust kingpin distribution model:**
```typescript
KP_SHARE: { min: 0.12, max: 0.35 }  // Range of kingpin share
KP_TO_DRIVE: 0.70  // Portion of kingpin load to drive axle
```

**Change front buffer zone:**
```typescript
FRONT_NO_STACK_BUFFER_CM: 120  // Front no-stack zone for heavy pallets
```

## Acceptance Criteria ✓

✅ **Heavy stacks land at the rear** - Default behavior enforced by `STACKS_FROM_REAR = true`

✅ **Light stacks can go to front** - When ≤500kg/pallet AND axle simulation passes

✅ **No regression for singles-only or stacks-only** - Bidirectional cursors handle both cases

✅ **No UI changes** - Only placement logic modified, visualization remains the same

✅ **Manifest logic unchanged** - Selection phase (STAGE 1) not touched

✅ **Same labeling** - Label counters and visual keys work identically

## Technical Notes

### Why This Approach Works

1. **Heuristic is Good Enough**: Linear kingpin share interpolation is operationally sufficient for go/no-go decisions
2. **Real-Time**: Simulation runs during placement, no pre-calculation needed
3. **Conservative**: 3% safety factor + tare weights prevent edge cases
4. **Flexible**: All constants easily configurable for different truck types

### Limitations

- Uses simplified 2D model (assumes uniform loading along width)
- Kingpin share is linear approximation (real distribution is more complex)
- Does not account for:
  - Dynamic forces (acceleration, braking)
  - Uneven pallet heights
  - Center of gravity variations within pallets

### Future Enhancements

If needed, you can:
1. Add zone-based kingpin shares (3 zones: front/mid/rear)
2. Track actual pallet weights from user input
3. Add visual indicators showing axle loads in UI
4. Implement per-truck-type tare configurations
5. Add warnings when approaching axle limits
