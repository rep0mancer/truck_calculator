App for calculating loadingspace

## Weight per meter approximation

The application now calculates an approximate axle load by dividing the current
total weight by the usable length of the selected truck. When this value
exceeds 2,500&nbsp;kg per meter, a warning is shown:

```
ACHTUNG – mögliche Achslastüberschreitung: <value> kg/m
```

This serves only as a rough indicator and is not a substitute for official
vehicle data.
